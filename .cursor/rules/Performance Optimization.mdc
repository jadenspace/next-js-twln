Minimize client‑only code (useEffect/useState) where unnecessary.

Leverage Next.js 15 App Router optimizations:

Use Server Components by default for better performance

Use Client Components only when necessary (interactivity, browser APIs)

Implement proper loading.tsx and error.tsx files

Use Next.js Image component with proper optimization

Dynamically import non‑critical components with React.lazy + Suspense

Optimize images (WebP, width/height, lazy-loading, priority for above-fold)

Memoize expensive computations with useMemo

Wrap pure components in React.memo

Structure modules for effective tree‑shaking

Use Next.js built-in caching strategies:

Static generation with generateStaticParams

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Server-side caching with unstable_cache

Client-side caching with React Query/TanStack Query

Bundle optimization:

Use dynamic imports for code splitting

Implement proper loading states

Minimize JavaScript bundle size

Use Next.js built-in optimizations (Turbopack in development)
